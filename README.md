### Browser Requirements

noVNC uses many modern web technologies so a formal requirement list is not available. However these are the minimum versions we are currently aware of:
* Chrome 49, Firefox 44, Safari 10, Opera 36, IE 11, Edge 12


### Server Requirements

noVNC follows the standard VNC protocol, but unlike other VNC clients it does require WebSockets support. Many servers include support (e.g. [x11vnc/libvncserver](http://libvncserver.sourceforge.net/),
[QEMU](http://www.qemu.org/), and [MobileVNC](http://www.smartlab.at/mobilevnc/)), but for the others you need to use a WebSockets to TCP socket proxy. noVNC has a sister project [websockify](https://github.com/novnc/websockify) that provides a simple such proxy.


### Installation Requirements

Install the server side, TightVNC which is a remote desktop control software that enables remote accessibility. To install, use the following yum command as shown below.
``` 
 yum -y install tigervnc-server xorg-x11-fonts-Type1
```
```
 yum --enablerepo=epel -y install novnc python-websockify numpy 
```
``` 
vncserver :1
```

### Quick Start

* Download current Repo
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/astro7x/GNURadio-NoVNC
```
* Use the launch script to automatically download and start websockify, which
  includes a mini-webserver and the WebSockets proxy. The `--vnc` option is
  used to specify the location of a running VNC server:
```
./utils/launch.sh --vnc localhost:5901
```

* Point your browser to the cut-and-paste URL that is output by the launch   script. Hit the Connect button, enter a password if the VNC server has one configured, and enjoy!

### TODO
create a script to create random users to use the GNURadio-NoVNC service for a fixed timeslot and terminate/abort the connection after time slot duration.
